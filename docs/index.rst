pyfar - python packages for acoustics research
==============================================


Pyfar aims at providing signal processing methods, plotting functionality, and
interfacing with audio devices and instrumentation in a unified and
comprehensive framework for acoustics research. To ensure  good usability, the
pyfar ecosystem is developed with a strong focus on documentation. Test driven
development and continuous integration ensure stable and reliable code. Pyfar
packages are provided under the MIT open source license allowing unrestricted
educational and commercial use.

      SOFA files store spatially distributed acoustic data such as head-related
      transfer functions. Sofar can read, create, write, manipulate, and verify
      SOFA files.
