Reporting Issues
================

Contributions in the form of issue reports are highly appreciated as they help to improve
the quality of pyfar packages and projects.

Here are a couple of things to consider:

- We provide templates for issue reports on `GitHub <https://github.com/pyfar/>`_ to help you provide all necessary information. When opening a new issue, please select the most appropriate template and make sure to fill out all required fields.
- When reporting bugs, please make sure to include a minimal reproducible example as well as information about your environment (e.g., operating system, Python version, pyfar version, and any other relevant packages).
- If you have access, you may also help categorizing issues by applying appropriate labels.
- If you are unsure about how to report an issue or which template to use, please feel free to reach out to us through `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pyfar/shared_invite/zt-2eacdhww2-iUiPnh_wuqg2zD939wL4kw>`_ or send an email to info@pyfar.org.
- If you want to work on the issue yourself, please feel free to indicate this in the issue description or open a pull request (see the `Developer Guidelines <pr_workflow>`_ for more information).
- If you are planning a larger feature or change, please consider discussing this first in a GitHub issue or on `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pyfar/shared_invite/zt-2eacdhww2-iUiPnh_wuqg2zD939wL4kw>`_ or send an email to info@pyfar.org before opening a pull request.
