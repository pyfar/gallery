Development Workflow
====================

All pyfar related projects and packages are developed openly on GitHub.
Contributions are managed through issues and pull requests, allowing communication
between users, developers, and maintainers.
Pull requests can be proposed from forks of the repository for which a contribution
is to be committed.
For contributors who are part of the pyfar organization it is recommended to work on feature
branches on the repository directly.


Workflow in a Nutshell
----------------------

The workflow can very briefly be summarized as:

- Start a new feature branch for each set of edits that you do.
- Hack away!
- Push your feature branch to your own Github repo, and create a pull request.
- Request a review and wait for feedback
- If required, include the feedback from the review and update your code.
- A maintainer will merge your PR if two reviewers approved.

This way of working helps to keep work well organized.
