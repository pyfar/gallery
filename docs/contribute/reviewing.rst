Reviewing Contributions
=======================

Reviewing open pull requests (PRs) is an essential part of the contribution process.
By providing feedback and suggestions, reviewers help maintain the quality and consistency of the project and help moving it forward.
All pyfar packages require at least two approving review before a PR can be merged.
For small changes, such as fixing small issues or updating the documentation, one approving review is usually sufficient.
