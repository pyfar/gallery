Templating
==========

All pyfar packages are created using a custom `cookiecutter template <https://pyfar-cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io>`_.
This template helps to set up a new package including the skeleton structure for code and documentation, necessary configuration files, and testing infrastructure.
Please refer to the respective `tutorial page <https://pyfar-cookiecutter-pypackage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#tutorial>`_ for detailed instructions on how to use cookiecutter and our template.
