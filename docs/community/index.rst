      If you want to add code or documentation, a good starting point for ideas
      are the issues on GitHub. The GitHub projects are linked through the
      Code buttons `pyfar.org <https://pyfar.org>`_. If you have own ideas for contributions, may it be
      code, or other things, it would be best to get in touch through `Slack <https://join.slack.com/t/pyfar/shared_invite/zt-2eacdhww2-iUiPnh_wuqg2zD939wL4kw>`_
      or info@pyfar.org. Before starting, please have a look at the guidelines.
