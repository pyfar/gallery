    "Pyfar implements five normalizations  after [Ahrens at al. (2020)](http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=20838) that can be applied to spectra after the DFT. The normalizations are implicitly used by the [pyfar.Signal class](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/classes/pyfar.audio.html#pyfar.classes.audio.Signal), and are available from [pyfar.dsp.fft.normalization](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/pyfar.dsp.fft.html#pyfar.dsp.fft.normalization). For a Signal object `signal`, `signal.freq` contains the normalized spectrum according to `signal.fft_norm` and `signal.freq_raw` contains the raw spectrum without any normalization. **The time data (**`signal.time`**) does not change regardless of the normalization.**"
