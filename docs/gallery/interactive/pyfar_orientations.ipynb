    "# Orientations\n",
    "\n",
    "The [pyfar.Orientations](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/pyfar.orientations.html) class is designed for storing, manipulating, and accessing orientation vectors. Examples for this are orientations of directional loudspeakers during measurements or head orientations. \n",
    "\n",
    "An orientation can be visualized with the triple of view, up and right vectors and it is tied to the object’s local coordinate system. Alternatively the object's orientation can be illustrated with help of the right hand: Thumb (view), forefinger (up) and middle finger (right). This means that the right vector is not required to define a Orientation. Note define a valid Orientation, the view and up vector need to be orthogonal to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) is not able to deal with view and up vectors, thats why we extended this it.\n",
    "In other words,  [pyfar.Orientations](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/pyfar.orientations.html) is inherited from [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html) and that all methods of this class can also be used with [pyfar.Orientations](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/pyfar.orientations.html). And [pyfar.Orientations](https://pyfar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/classes/pyfar.orientations.html) can cover view and up vectors. "
